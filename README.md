Never forget your expenses!.

Monee will be avaliable in various platforms so you can use it everywhere.

## Features

You can register:

- currencies: the currency of your expenses
- actors: individuals or organizations you work with
- wallets: your current balances
- in-debts: debts from others to you
- out-debts: debts from you to others

monee will store all you data in events, so you can register, repair, rebuild, and analyze your data.
monee has two levels of transactions:

- events: low level transactions that express raw money movements.
- procedures: atomic group of events that are executed together and provide more information about the transaction, e.g. transferences, buys, sales, payments, money conversion, etc.

## Future plans

Monee is planned to be a self-hosted service that can be reached from any device in a secure way.

Significant contributions will be acknowledged in the projectâ€™s documentation and release notes, but all official project credits and decision-making authority are reserved for the monee team.
